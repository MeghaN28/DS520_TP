Seattle lives in its neighborhoods and this is one of it's best ones.  From my place you can walk 2 blocks into the center of things where you can find enough to entertain you for days on end.  Want to go up to Ballard, over to Gasworks Park, or downtown?  Grab a bike and be anywhere in 10-15 minutes!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </span></td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/5941732/bd8f401a_original.jpg </td><td>601600</td><td>⋯</td><td>4.98</td><td>4.97</td><td>4.91</td><td>STR-OPLI-19-000772 </td><td>f</td><td> 2</td><td>2</td><td> 0</td><td>0</td><td>3.41</td></tr>\n",
